# VGG-pytorch
VGG for Vietnamese Currency recognition

# Introduction   
Here is my pytorch implementation of the model described in the [VGG paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556) for **Vietnamese Currency recognition**.

# Setting 

I run the model in a machine named NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti with batch_size = 8 and epoch = 6. (This is the maximum milestone that my device can reach xD)
